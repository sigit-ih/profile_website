      "Hello, I'm Sigit Ispramono Hadi. I'm a developer with a focus on developing web interfaces using React, Tailwind, and JavaScript. I enjoy building clean, user-friendly, and functional websites. I'm deeply interested in Web Development and Artificial Intelligence. I believe that technology is always evolving, therefore I committed to continuously learn and improve my skills. I actively participate in various webinars, training programs, and self-explorations to deepen my knowledge in both web development and the use of data and AI. For me, every project is an opportunity to grow and discover something new.",
